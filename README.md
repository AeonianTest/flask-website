## Flask experimentations

This project is a basic exploration in the python Flask framework for personal learning, leveraging various Flask extensions to host the frame of a personal website, and to manage and handle a contact form defensively against potential abuses. 

Additionally it handles mail functionality with Flask-Mail, coordinating with an smtp mail server to direct emails from form to the site owner.
